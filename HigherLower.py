"""Higher/Lower Guessing Game."""
import random as ra
from datetime import datetime


# This program allows the user to select a difficulty by first choosing the lowest
# and highest possible numbers the game will use. A random number is generated and then
# in a loop the user is prompted to make a guess, this guess is the compared to the actual
# number and a prompt is given depending on if they are correct, or higher/lower than the
# random number. During game play the number of guesses are counted and once the game is over
# then the game summary is written to a text file with the current date & time.


# ---Points for improvement---

# - Extend this program to ask the for the name in a safer way, perhaps with a while loop?

# - Write additional logic into the gameplay loop so that each guess is stored
#Â   in a list and then if the user makes a duplicate guess, they are warned?

# - Ask for the guess in a safer way.

# - Make the gameplay loop give a warning if a number is guessed that is outside
#   the range of what is allowed? (Say if the low, high is 1, 10 but the user guesses a 12 for example).

# - Write a function to read the existing score file to the user before gameplay commences.

# - Difficult.. Make this a 2 player game!
